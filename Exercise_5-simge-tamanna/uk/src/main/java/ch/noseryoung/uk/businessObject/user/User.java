// This is an example class on how a domain model could be built
// These annotations show hibernate that this is an entity
@Entity
// This annotation defines this entity as it's own table with it's given name
// We can also not define it's name, but then it'd take the name of the class itself and that wouldn't be best practice
// This naming pattern is an exception and not best practice, as the term user is reserved we went with the plural

    // In many to many relations the data type is preferred to be a Set for performance, in one to many and many to one
